**<span style="color: #e74c3c;">About</span>**

<span style="color: #2c3e50;">
I am a dedicated researcher specializing in computer vision, with expertise in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and deep learning. I am currently an Erasmus Mundus Joint Master’s degree student in [Computational Color and Spectral Imaging (COSI)](https://cosi-master.eu/), studying across the [Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU)](https://www.ntnu.no/gjovik), [University Jean Monnet (UJM)](https://www.univ-st-etienne.fr/en/index.html), and the [University of Eastern Finland (UEF)](https://www.uef.fi/en). My work focuses on developing innovative solutions in image processing, spectral imaging, and AI-driven visual perception.

**<span style="color: #e74c3c;">Research Interests</span>**

<span style="color: #2c3e50;">
My research areas include spectral imaging, color science, computer vision, and explainable AI. I am passionate about creating reliable systems for visual perception that generalize across varying domains, with a focus on spectral illumination design, color vision accuracy, and optimization techniques such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO).
