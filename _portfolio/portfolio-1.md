### Project Overview

This project presents an innovative approach to urban planning by integrating state-of-the-art geospatial AI tools into land use analysis and development planning. It focuses on combining data-driven insights with scalable AI solutions to support sustainable urban growth and smarter city design.

### Key Features

- **Spectral Unmixing** for identifying and classifying complex land cover types.
- **Object Detection** using [Qwen2.5](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen-2-5), applied to high-resolution satellite imagery.
- **Visual Content Retrieval** through LLAMA Index, enabling semantic image search and classification.
- **Generative Urban Planning** using Large Language Models (LLMs) to propose infrastructure layouts, zoning strategies, and public space designs.

### Highlight

Most recently, I co-developed this geospatial AI prototype during the [Sohjo Hackathon](https://businessjoensuu.fi/sohjo-hacks-hackathon), where we integrated multiple modalities into a unified platform for urban planning experts and local authorities.

### Technologies Used

- Python, PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers
- LLAMA Index, LangChain
- Remote sensing datasets and spectral image processing
- Jupyter notebooks and Streamlit for prototyping

### Outcome

The system was highly praised during the hackathon for its real-world applicability and innovative integration of AI with urban data. It demonstrates the potential of generative models in solving complex spatial problems and enhancing policy-making in urban contexts.
