### Project Overview

This project explores the linguistic cues that subconsciously influence how humans perceive text authored by either a human or an AI model such as ChatGPT. By leveraging eye-tracking data, we identify patterns in visual attention and correlate them with specific parts of speech in the text.

### Methodology

We used the **Tobii Pro** eye tracker to record participant gaze behavior as they read various text samples â€” some written by humans, others generated by AI. From this, we extracted key features including:

- **Total Fixation Count**
- **Fixation Duration**
- **Scanpath Sequence**

These were analyzed using the **Velocity Threshold Identification (I-VT)** algorithm at two threshold settings: 30Â°/s and 100Â°/s, to explore both coarse and fine-grained reading behavior.

### Key Findings

- For **human-written text**, participants primarily fixated on **nouns**, indicating focus on factual content and subjects.
- For **AI-generated text**, participants showed more fixation on **adjectives**, reflecting attention to stylistic or exaggerated elements commonly used by language models to enhance fluency or appeal.

### Conclusion

Our study highlights consistent behavioral patterns that reflect cognitive processing differences between human and AI-generated writing. The insights could be valuable for:

- Detecting AI-authored content  
- Improving readability of generated text  
- Understanding human trust in machine-written communication

This research contributes to the emerging field of explainable AI perception and computational psycholinguistics.
